        <p class="lead mb-4">School counselors assist students at all levels, from elementary school to college. They act as advocates for studentsâ€™ well-being, and as valuable resources for their educational advancement. As a school counselor, youâ€™ll first and foremost listen to studentsâ€™ concerns. Because everyoneâ€™s home and social life is different, you could be the only person who fulfills that need for them at a given time. Children and young adults need guidance and support, especially when it comes to dealing with academic, personal, parental and social pressures. Helping people reach their potential should be your number one goalâ€”and to achieve it you should be caring, flexible, adaptable and patient. You may help students with issues such as bullying, disabilities, low self-esteem, poor academic performance and relationship troubles. You can refer them to a psychologist or mental health counselor for further treatment if necessary. In addition, youâ€™ll evaluate studentsâ€™ abilities, interests and personalities to help them develop realistic academic and career goals. Youâ€™ll facilitate aptitude tests and formulate potential paths to success.
